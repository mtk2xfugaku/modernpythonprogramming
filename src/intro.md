# Introduction

Python is one of the most used programming languages ever, and has become the lingua franca of modern data science and machine learning. The book assumes no previous python experience and introduces everything from scratch. Part 1 of the book is about the python language itself, about how python works its different implementations and how to start writing python. Part 2 is about using what you have learnt in Part 1 to build small projects, design patters and general references about python programming.

This book is fully opensource and free to use and the code is under the MIT License unless stated otherwise. Anyone is welcomed to contribute to this book, especially part 2. Even though Python is a general purpose language as we move futher into the book my main focus is mostly on high performance computing, machine learning and python's role in it.
